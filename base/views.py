"""
This module contains views for handling user authentication, room management, and messaging in the linkUp application.

Key Functions:
- loginPage: Handles user login, including form submission and authentication.
- logoutUser: Logs out the current user and redirects to the home page.
- registerPage: Manages user registration, including form validation and user creation.
- home: Displays the home page with a list of rooms, topics, and recent messages based on search queries.
- room: Displays a specific room's details, including messages and participants.
- userProfile: Shows the profile of a specific user, including their rooms and messages.
- createRoom: Allows authenticated users to create a new room.
- updateRoom: Enables the host of a room to update its details.
- deleteRoom: Allows the host to delete a room.
- deleteMessage: Enables users to delete their own messages.
- updateUser: Allows users to update their profile information.
- topicsPage: Displays a list of topics based on search queries.
- activityPage: Shows all room messages for activity tracking.

Dependencies:
- Django's built-in authentication system for user management.
- Django Channels for real-time messaging capabilities.
- Custom models (Room, Topic, Message, User) and forms for handling data.

Usage:
- Each function corresponds to a specific URL pattern defined in the application's routing configuration.
- Ensure that the user is authenticated for actions that modify data (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting rooms/messages).
